Introduction to Arducam for Raspberry Pi
========================================
General Introduction
Arducam always caters to the unmet needs and has released a series of alternatives to the Raspberry Pi cameras. Here you can find cameras with optimized optical performance, miniature form factor, programmable motorized focus, global shutter, higher resolution, pan-tilt-zoom control and so on.

This introduction will walk you through our product lines for the Raspberry Pi camera and let you know how Arducam fulfills all kinds of needs.

Pivariety Camera Modules

For a long time, Raspberry Pi users are limited to use the closed-source official supported camera driver and camera modules (V1/V2/HQ). Now Arducam made it possible to provide well-tuned ISP for Pivariety camera modules with Auto Exposure, Auto White Balance, Auto Gain Control, Lens Shading Correction, etc. Now it supports the high-resolution sensors 21MP IMX230, 16MP IMX298, the Starvis sensors IMX290, IMX327, IMX462, the global shutter sensors OV7251, OV9281, 0V2311, OG02B10, AR0234, etc. Learn More

Natively Compatible Camera Modules

Namely 5MP OV5647, 8MP IMX219 and 12MP IMX477 High Quality cameras. These customized camera modules use the native drivers to work so they are perfect alternatives to the official modules and could be used under the same commands. However, we’ve added some extra features to the camera board, and you can choose from M12/CS/C mount lens, switchable IR filter for daylight and night vision, miniature-size spy camera, programmable motorized focus cameras(The motorized focus camera gives the user a much clear and sharp image compared to the official Pi camera even provides the FREX and STROBE signals which can be used for multi-camera synchronize capture with proper camera driver firmware) You can decide what you see and how and when you want to see it.

MIPI Camera Modules

The official camera driver only supports OV5647 5MP, IMX219 8MP and IMX477 12MP cameras. If you want to use other cameras rather than OV5647/IMX219/IMX477, you can use our MIPI camera Modules for Raspberry Pi which let you use almost any MIPI camera modules on Raspberry Pi. The drivers for these cameras are V4L2 friendly and support basic video mirror/flip and manual exposure/gain settings. Learn More

You can also use our Arducam USB camera shield which can help you add multiple higher performance cameras to a single Raspberry Pi board.

Pan-tilt-zoom Camera on Raspberry Pi

A PTZ camera is not a still camera. Instead, it could move the camera and the lens for directional and zoom control, and that means a single camera can be used to monitor places that should be covered by multiple ones. Now a new PTZ camera is coming to the Raspberry Pi. Learn More

Multi-camera Adapter Board

What if you want to connect more than one camera to a single CSI camera port on Raspberry Pi board? We got a quadruple adapter and a doubleplexer for you. Learn More

Camera Case

Arducam can design cases for the camera module either with acrylic or 3D printers. We also provide tutorials of assembling the cases. Learn More
