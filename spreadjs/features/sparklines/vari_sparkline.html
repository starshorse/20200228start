Option	Description
variance	A number or reference that represents the bar length, such as 2 or "A1".
reference	A number or reference that represents the location of the reference line, such as 0 or "A2". This setting is optional. The default value is 0.
mini	A number or reference that represents the minimum value of the sparkline, such as -5 or "A3". This setting is optional. The default value is -1.
maxi	A number or reference that represents the maximum value of the sparkline, such as 5 or "A4". This setting is optional. The default value is 1.
mark	A number or reference that represents the position of the mark line, such as 3 or "A5". This setting is optional.
tickunit	A number or reference that represents a tick unit, such as 1 or "A6". This setting is optional. The default value is 0.
legend	A boolean that represents whether to display the text. The default is optional. The default value is FALSE.
colorPositive	A string that represents the color sheme for variance and is larger than reference. This setting is optional. The default value is "green".
colorNegative	A string that represents the color scheme for variance and is smaller than reference. This setting is optional. The default value is "red".
vertical	A boolean that represents whether to display the sparkline vertically. This setting is optional. The default value is FALSE.
The vari sparkline formula has the following format:

=VARISPARKLINE(variance, reference, mini, maxi, mark, tickunit, legend, colorPositive, colorNegative, vertical)
