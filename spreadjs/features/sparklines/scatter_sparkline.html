Option	Description
Points1	The first xy data series. If the row count is greater than or equal to the column count, use data from the first two columns. The first column contains x-values and the second column contains y-values. If the row count is less than the column count, use data from the first two rows. The first row contains x-values and the second row contains y-values.
Points2	The second xy data series. If the row count is greater than or equal to the column count, use data from the first two columns. The first column contains x-values and the second column contains y-values. If the row count is less than the column count, use data from the first two rows. The first row contains x-values and the second row contains y-values.
MinX	The x-minimum limit of both series, each series has its own value if it is omitted.
MaxX	The x-maximum limit of both series, each series has its own value if it is omitted.
MinY	The y-minimum limit of both series, each series has its own value if it is omitted.
MaxY	The y-maximum limit of both series, each series has its own value if it is omitted.
HLine	The horizontal axis position, there is no line if it is omitted.
VLine	The vertical axis position, there is no line if it is omitted.
XMinZone	The x-minimum value of the gray zone, there is no grey zone if any of these four parameters are omitted.
XMaxZone	The x-maximum value of the gray zone, there is no grey zone if any of these four parameters are omitted.
YMinZone	The y-minimum value of the gray zone, there is no grey zone if any of these four parameters are omitted.
YMaxZone	The y-maximum value of the gray zone, there is no grey zone if any of these four parameters are omitted.
Tags	If this option is true, mark the point at which the y-value is the maximum of the first series as "#0000FF", and mark the point at which the y-value is the minimum of the first series as "#CB0000". This option is false if it is omitted.
DrawSymbol	If this option is true, draw each point as a symbol. The symbol of the first series is a circle, and the symbol of the second series is a square. This option is true if it is omitted.
DrawLines	If this option is true, connect each point with a line by sequence in each series. This option is false if it is omitted.
Color1	The color string of the first point series. The value is "#969696" if it is omitted.
Color2	The color string of the second point series. The value is "#CB0000" if it is omitted.
Dash	If this option is true, the line is a dashed line; otherwise, the line is a full line. This option is false if it is omitted.
The scatter sparkline formula has the following format:

=SCATTERSPARKLINE(points1, points2, minX, maxX, minY, maxY, hLine, vLine, xMinZone, xMaxZone, yMinZone, yMaxZone, tags, drawSymbol, drawLines, color1, color2, dash)
